# Finding the `foo` system property

The goal of this repo is to test different environment variables to define system properties of a native graalVM executable at run time.

## Getting started

```bash
git@github.com:Mcdostone/graalvm-demo.git
cd graalvm-demp
./test.sh
```

The `test.sh` file:
 - builds the native executable.
 - runs the program with differents well-known java environment variables.
